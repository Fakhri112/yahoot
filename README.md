# Yahoot!

_A kahoot! Clone App_

---

## About Project

This is the biggest project I have developed on my own 😁. It was incredibly tiring to create this project from start to finish, but there is a sense of pride in seeing something I developed myself come to completion 🥳.

As you can see, this is a Kahoot! clone, but a lite version. There are many features from Kahoot! that I did not implement because I was already tired 😪. Oh yeah i make this website 90% responsive 📱 (At least don't rotate your phone to landscape, it still messed up 🙄😶)

Note: Due to the performance of React and limited browser resources, please do not leave or switch tabs during gameplay, as this can disrupt interactions between the host and players. 🖥🕹

Thank you 🤞.
